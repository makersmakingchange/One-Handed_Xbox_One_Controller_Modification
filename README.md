 # One-Handed Mods for Xbox One Controller

<!--- 
SUMMARY
A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.
 --->
This inexpensive 3D printed modification for the Xbox One controller will allow for the user to operate their Xbox One controller with one hand. This controller adaptation makes it easier for someone who may have a difficult time holding a controller with both hands, or has greater dexterity with one hand than the other.
